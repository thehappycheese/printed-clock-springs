# 3D Printed Clock Spring Calculations

Attempting to be able to design and print clock springs from PLA

Clock springs can easily be designed using OnShape and this feature script i found;

The notebooks in this repo have some empirical data and some calculations that
will hopefully let me design a clock spring with the perfect performance
characteristics.
